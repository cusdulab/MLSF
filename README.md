# MLSF machine-learning scoring function
Code and data for reproducing the results of machine-learning scoring functions versus classical scoring functions on similarity-based benchmarks, presented in the paper by Li et al. [1]. This repository is a fork of <https://github.com/HongjianLi/MLSF>.

## Directories
* `CASF-2016` contains data and results on the CASF-2016 benchmark.
* `Blind-2018` contains data and results on the Blind-2018 benchmark.
* `Code` contains the source code in R, Perl and Bash programming languages.

## Files
* `ScoringPower.xlsx` contains the Rp performances of various scoring functions on four benchmarks.
